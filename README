This project contains all the code to build a shared library for decoding
WavPack files on the Android platform. This code uses the 4.60.1 code base.

For the patches needed to add the shared library to Android, please see:

A test suite of sample WavPack files is available from:
http://www.wavpack.com/downloads.html

The generated (ARM) shared library is approximately 58K in size, if you require
a slightly smaller file (approx 54KB) you can achieve this by commenting out
the following line in unpack.c

#define FAST_DECODE
